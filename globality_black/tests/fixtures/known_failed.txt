# In some cases, we know globality-black fails, but haven't had the time to prioritise this
# # Feel free to use the `#fmt: off/on` feature

# 1. We don't have full coverage of nested comprehensions. See below for a couple of non-covered
# examples.
# While do explode every comprehension that contains an inner comprehension,
# we do not explode the inner comprehension itself. This requires big changes, but it's usually ok
# what we're doing now.
x = [[i for i in range(8) if i < 4] for j in range(10)]

food = [[get_food(self) for i in range(4) if i < 4] for j in range(10)]


# 2. While list comprehensions are exploded if they have an if, ternary operators are not. These
seem not to complex to cover, but unfortunately the following gets formatted today:

def read_df(path: Path):
    return (
         pd.read_excel(path, engine="openpyxl")
         if path.name.endswith("xlsx")
         else pd.read_csv(path)
    ).assign(correction_source=path.name)


# 3. For single element subscripts, we don't explode even if there is a magic comma. Example:

my_df = my_df[
    ["col1", "col2", *my_df.columns[2:]],
]

Gets compressed to a single line
