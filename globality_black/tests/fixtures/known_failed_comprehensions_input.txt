# We don't have full coverage of nested comprehensions. See below for a couple of non-covered
# examples.
# While do explode every comprehension that contains an inner comprehension,
# we do not explode the inner comprehension itself. This requires big changes, but it's usually ok
# what we're doing now.
# If you really would like to explode the inner comprehension, feel free to
# use the `#fmt: off/on` feature
